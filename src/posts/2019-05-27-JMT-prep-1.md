The [John Muir Trail](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/john-muir-trail/) (JMT), 211 miles from Yosemite Valley to Mount Whitney, is deemed one of the best (if not _the_ best) hiking trails in the United States. A backpacking trail through the Sierra Nevadas, over snow lined passes and gorgeous mountain scenery, the JMT has been a blessing to all wilderness explorers for the past 81 years, since 1938. While I have yet to personally hike this trail, that is my goal this Summer.

The JMT is often talked about as one of the best backpacking treks in North America and while I do have some experience backpacking, I wouldn't say I'm a "professional", more of a hobbyist. In that regard, I am both terrified and excited for one of the greatest physical and emotional challenges of my life. Luckily (unluckily?) for me, I will only be doing a segment of the JMT. My brother, Tim, and his girlfriend, Karter, will be doing the entier JMT from Yoesmite Valley to the summit of Mount Whitney. I will be joining them for the last two weeks fo the trek, from Edison Lake to Mount Whitney.

What is the John Muir Trail? What is its history? Significance?

What is our plan? Where do I join Tim and Karter?

How am I working to be in physical shape?
