I am ecstatic! I have received, and accepted, an offer of admission to the University of Michigan's [Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://lsa.umich.edu/earth). Dr. Chris Poulsen will be my advisor as I research the equilibrium climate sensitivity of Earth's past, present, and future in Chris' [Climate Change Research Group](https://www.umclimate.com).

This is a dream come true for me. I have always had a passion for learning and scientific research. Pursing a graduate degree was something I knew I wanted to pursue after receiving my bachelor's degree. However, school was tiring. I was ready to be an "adult" and try out a real job in the real world. Boy, I am happy with my choice to do just that. 

Having been a software engineer in the big apple for the past 4 years has been a great experience for me, both personally and professionally. I have made some great friends and learned a lot about project management, time management, software development, and what it means to be a "professional." I am now excited to jump back into research and school with my new skills and world experience.

I am pursuing a Ph.D. because I am curious. I want to learn. I want to explore. And I want to discover something new. Hopefully at the end of my schooling I can continue on as a researcher. 

Going on to explore past climates and future climates using computer simulations is a dream come true and a great combination of all of my interests:

* Deep time, the rock record, and past environments
* Climate change and what our future holds
* Computer science and data analysis

I am really, really looking forward to this. 

I plan on blogging about various topics as I discover (or rediscover them!) throughout my academic career. From geologic time, to dinosaurs, to Ekman transport. I want to use this platform to both inform and learn. I hope to improve both my writing and my understanding by explaining these topics to the great wide world.
