# JMT Reflection
The JMT is 213 miles of awesome. For the first two weeks of August, 2019 I was lucky enough to hike the Southern half of the trail. 123 miles from Lake Edison to the summit of Mt. Whitney. This was one of the best experiences of my life and something that I will remember forever. I learned a few things along the way, about myself, about nature, and about community.

The whole idea of the trip came from my brother, [Tim](https://timkeeler.net), who somehow heard about this lovely trail. He, and his girlfriend Karter, did the entire JMT and I joined them for the last half of the trip (partly to make their resupply easier ðŸ˜‰). If there is one thing I regret, is that I didn't take off more time and do the entire thing with them.

Coming away from this trip I felt it was necessary to capture that "just off the trail" feeling and enlightenment attained from being out in nature. This was one of the first times I ever felt a "part of nature" and it's hard to describe the feelings one has when hiking through the imposing peaks of the Sierra Nevada.
