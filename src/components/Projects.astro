        Restoration is a replay parser for <Link
          to="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1934680/Age_of_Mythology_Retold/">Age of Mythology: Retold</Link
        > written in <Link to="https://go.dev/">Go</Link>. The replay format for AoM is not publicly documented. With
        the help of some community members, we have reversed engineered a majority of the file format, which lists game
        commandsâ€”actions taken by each player. This parser takes those raw commands and formats them into a sane,
        human readable JSON format (and does it quickly).

        aomstats.io is a website that tracks God win rates and players stats for
        <Link to="https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aom/age-of-mythology-retold/">Age of Mythology: Retold</Link>. It
        is written using Python on the backend for data munging and scrapping. It uses Svelte and SvelteKit on frontend.

        aoestats.io is a website I created that periodically, and automatically, calculates statistics for the
        <Link to="https://www.ageofempires.com/">Age of Empires II</Link>
        video game. The backend and stats code is written with Python and Django. Stats are calculated daily. The frontend
        is written with
        <Link to="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</Link> and
        <Link to="https://nuxt.com/">Nuxt</Link>. The site is hosted on a
        <Link to="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</Link> VPS.

        The first of its kind CCMS (Choral Catalog Management System). It's a power tool for choral music directors to
        manage, tag, and organize their sheet music. The idea is to make searching your music inventory easier and
        unlock your ability to put together killer musical programs.
      </P>
      <P>
        The code can be found
        <Link to="https://github.com/jerkeeler/choralcat">on GitHub</Link>. The application is a
        <Link to="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</Link> application with
        <Link to="https://alpinejs.dev">AlpineJS</Link> and
        <Link to="https://htmx.org">htmx</Link> for some light interactivity. I went overboard and integrated a CI/CD pipeline
        and a full observability stack.
