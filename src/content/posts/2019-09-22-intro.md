Welcome to my web log. Colloquially known as a "blog" ðŸ˜† Ok, maybe that's a bit too tongue in cheek.

This blog doesn't have a topic, per se, and will contain posts related to my interests, hobbies, current events, or whatever else crosses my mind. There is no formula here.

The blog is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted/distributed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Take a look around and enjoy!
