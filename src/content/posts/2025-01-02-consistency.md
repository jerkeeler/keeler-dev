Consistency is boring.

It’s repetitive. It’s unremarkable. It rarely produces a good story on day one.

That’s why it works.

For 2026, my theme is **consistency**. I’ve noticed a pattern in myself: I like the idea of change.[^1] I like the first week of a new routine. I like the novelty of new tools, new plans, new "systems." But I also know where that movie ends: lots of restarting, lots of ramp-up time, and not much compounding.

If motivation were reliable, this would be easy. But motivation is a terrible scheduler. It shows up late, it leaves early, and it doesn’t care about your calendar.

Consistency is what you do after motivation stops texting back.

## The unsexy middle

It’s easy to romanticize mastery: "10,000 hours," overnight success, the highlight reel. But most skill isn’t built in highlight reels. It’s built in the unsexy middle—the quiet repetitions that don’t feel like progress until they suddenly do.

Music makes this painfully obvious.

I’ve been practicing ukulele, and the truth is you don’t become a musician by thinking about music. You become one by sitting down and practicing when you don’t feel like it. Your fingers aren’t cooperating. The chord change is sloppy. Your rhythm drifts. You play the same transition until you’re annoyed at yourself.

And then, also annoyingly, something clicks. The chord change that felt impossible yesterday is just… doable. Not perfect, but there. The difference isn’t talent. It’s repetition.

There’s a Bruce Lee quote that’s been rattling around in my head for years: _"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."_ One kick. Again. Again. Again.

For me, it’s the same chord progression. The same arpeggios. Again. Again. Again.

Running works the same way.

Nobody runs a marathon overnight. You run boring miles. Easy miles. Recovery runs that feel too slow to count. You build a base. You do it when it’s cold, or dark, or inconvenient. You do it when the run is forgettable and the best part is being done. You do the slow Zone 2 runs that feel more like a fast walk and think, "Is this even running?"

Then a few months later, you notice your "normal" pace is faster. Your "long run" is longer. The thing that used to feel like a big deal is now Tuesday.

That’s what consistency does. It turns the extraordinary into the ordinary.

## Boredom isn’t a bug

There’s a trap here: consistency is boring and boredom can feel like a signal that something is wrong. It’s wired into our monkey brains that boring is bad. The brain wants the dopamine hit. It wants novelty.

We live in a world that rewards novelty. New apps. New plans. New gear. New routines. New identities. New 30-second TikTok videos about turtles. Boredom can feel like stagnation, like you’re missing out, like you should pivot. And consistency—predictability, routine—can feel like a cage.

But boredom is also what it feels like to stop thrashing.

To stop and breathe.

To enjoy.

To be present.

To be consistent.

It’s the emotional texture of the middle.

And the middle is where you grow up. It’s where you learn. It’s where you build an actual relationship with the thing you’re doing—whether that’s an instrument, a sport, or a craft. Consistency shapes your understanding of the world because it forces you to see reality up close, not just the fantasy version.

It also shapes your understanding of yourself.

There’s something grounding about routines you keep. When you show up in small ways every day, you become more anchored. You start to trust yourself. You’re not relying on a burst of energy or a perfect week—you’re building a quiet track record.

When I switch routines constantly, I feel less grounded. It’s not dramatic, but it’s real: my days feel slippery. I spend more time deciding than doing. I’m always "starting," which is a sneaky way of never arriving.

Consistency is boring because it removes drama.

It’s fewer fresh starts. Fewer reinventions. Fewer dopamine hits. More doing the thing on the day you said you would.

It’s also comforting.

At some point, consistency stops feeling like discipline and starts feeling like identity. You don’t need to win the day. You just need to show up.

That’s the shift I want in 2026: not heroic streaks, not perfection—just a steadier relationship with the things I care about.

## My boring 2026 rules

- **Ukulele, daily.** Even if it’s short. At minimum: pick it up and play for five minutes.
- **Movement, daily.** A walk. A hike. A run. As the adage goes, life is a marathon, not a sprint.
- **Do not over optimize.** Less selection paralysis. More reps.
- **One sentence, daily.** One sentence of journaling, of writing, of thinking.

One rule I’m leaning on: **never miss twice.** Missing once is life, it happens. Missing twice is the beginning of a new identity.

Consistency is boring.

Until it isn’t.

Until you start noticing tiny improvements.

Until the routine becomes familiar.

Until the boring parts become the life you actually live.

And that’s the point.
