Below you will find a montage of my video footage, captured on a [GoPro Hero Session 5](https://gopro.com/en/us/yourhero5/session), from my [John Muir Trail backpacking trip](/posts/jmt-overview) in August 2019. The video was edited in iMovie. The montage doesn't contain any music or voice over. Just a bunch of clips spliced together for some hiking montage goodness.

Enjoy!
