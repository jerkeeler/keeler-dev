I'll keep this short. AI is happening. Vibe coding is happening. Whether you and I like it or not, it's here.

The tech blogosphere over the last month has been absolutely abuzz with vibe coding and Claude Code glazing[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6].

I've tried it myself. It works surprisingly well.

Is it the future? **Yes.**

Is it overhyped? Most certainly, **yes.**

Will it put people out of jobs? **Yes.**

Will software engineers need to "know how to vibe code"? Unfortunately... **yes.**

Is there current suite of claude code, vibe coding, #yolo modes the final product? **No.**

It's here, it's happening. I don't necessarily like it. It is cool. I mean, who thought we could make machines do this?! But I don't like it. It takes the soul out of programming. The blood, sweat, and tears. But it _is_ cool.

We're in for a wild ride.
